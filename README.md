# Emoji Localization and Classification  

I've always wanted to work on a Computer Vision project using TensorFlow and share it on my GitHub. When I came across the [Object Localization with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/projects/object-localization-tensorflow) project on Coursera, I decided to customize it and create my own version.  

## Project Overview  

This project uses TensorFlow to localize and classify a single emoji on a plain white background. I implemented the model based on VGG16 and visualized the accuracy and error metrics.  

## Limitations  

- The model can only detect **one emoji at a time**.  
- It **does not support multiple instance detection**.  

## Getting Started  

To run this project, follow these steps:  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
2. Open jupyter notebook
