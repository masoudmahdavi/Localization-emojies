# Localization and Classification Emojies
For a long time, I wanted to do a project about Computer Vision and Tensorflow and push it to my GitHub, when I saw a project called [Object Localization with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/projects/object-localization-tensorflow) in Coursera Project Network, I decided to customize the project and push it to my GitHub.

The project is about the localization and classification of emojis on one screen (there is a white background here), which was done using the Tensorflow library. I implemented the model as VGG16 and finally plotted the accuracy and error graphs. I push
This project cannot recognize multiple instances and can only detect one instance at a time
